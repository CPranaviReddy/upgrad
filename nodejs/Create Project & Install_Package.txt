==================== Install the Packages locally in project=========================
Syntax: npm i <package_name>
eg: npm i nodemon

1. we will see nodemon is installed inside the package.json file
2. just add  below in  the scripts
  "start": "nodemon demo.js"   (demo.js is the name of the file)

create a file with demo.js:
console.log('We are into NODEJS')

(1) node demo.js
this will only run the file directly and display the output

(2) npm start
this will go to package.json file and whatever the script is there with the filename it will execute it and if you make any changes in the file it will automatically display the output without running
now make any changes in the file it will automatically display


================= Install nodemon globally ================

npm i -g nodemon

you can execute any file from anywhere

1. co inside NodeWS folder
2. nodemon hello.js
